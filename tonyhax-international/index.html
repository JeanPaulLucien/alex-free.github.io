<p>Brought to you by <a href="http://www.psxdev.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=867">MottZilla</a>, <a href="http://www.psxdev.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6018">Alex Free</a>, and <a href="http://www.psxdev.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6714">Patchouli (karehaani)</a>. Built on the work of many <a href="#credits">others</a>.</p>
<p>Tonyhax International is a fork of the <a href="https://orca.pet/tonyhax/">Tonyhax</a> “Software backup loader exploit thing for the Sony PlayStation 1” originally created by <a href="https://github.com/socram8888">Socram8888</a>. Tonyhax International is developed by Alex Free and MottZilla with many new features and upgrades compared to the original Tonyhax, some of which are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Supports all PS1 Consoles (Japanese, American, European, SCPH-1000-SCPH-102) <strong>and</strong> Early PS2 Consoles (Japanese, American, European, SCPH-10000-SCPH-39004).</p></li>
<li><p>Supports starting the Tonyhax International loader with <a href="gameshark-code.html">GameShark Codes</a> and any PSX cheat device using the new GameSharkHAX boot method.</p></li>
<li><p>Supports <a href="flashed-cheat-cart.html">flashing</a> the Tonyhax International backup/import loader to a GameShark, Action Reply, or similar PSX cheat cartridge. Whenever the flashed cartridge is plugged into the back of a PSX console model with a cartridge port on the back when you power it on the Tonyhax International will boot instead of the shell program/BIOS (Sony screens/CD Player/Memory Card Manager).</p></li>
<li><p>Supports <strong>more <a href="save-game-exploit.html">save game exploits</a></strong>, enabling the use of even more PSX game discs to start the Tonyhax International loader.</p></li>
<li><p>Uses the newer <a href="https://github.com/brad-lin/FreePSXBoot">FreePSXBoot</a> exploit and patching methods to disable FreePSXBoot memory cards that boot Tonyhax International after the FreePSXBoot exploit starts the loader from the memory card. This <strong>works on all BIOS versions on all supported consoles.</strong></p></li>
<li></li>
<li><p>Supports more <a href="anti-piracy-bypass.html">games with additional copy protection routines</a>, by <strong>using a completely different anti-piracy bypass system.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Uses a completely different build system that is portable to many more Linux distributions. This new build system is more efficient and easier to use as well.</p></li>

<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A new and exciting boot method known as <a href="gameshark-code.html">GameSharkHAX</a> has been added to Tonyhax International. This is a brand new ‘way in’ to the Tonyhax International loader for all PS1 and PS2 consoles that are supported by Tonyhax International (SCPH-1000-SCPH-39004). It uses GameShark codes to boot the Tonyhax International loader off a memory card file <strong>mid-game.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Condensed the <a href="boot-cd.html">Boot CD</a> back to just one BIN+CUE file set. It is not actually necessary to have 2 different versions of the Boot CD, the single BIN+CUE file set in all Tonyhax International releases from here on out will work in every supported use case.</p></li>
<li><p>The documentation has been split into multiple markdown and html files. This makes it much more easy to maintain for me, and easier for you to comprehend, read, and share. The ‘all in one html file’ style before became unmanageable due to the sheer amount of info that has been added since the initial release.</p></li>

<p><a href="changelog.html">About previous versions</a>.</p>
<h2 id="usage-1">Usage</h2>
<p>The Tonyhax International loader is the program that once started enables the use of backup CD-Rs or import PS1 discs. The Tonyhax International loader can be booted with a [flashed cheat cart] (flashed-cheat-cart.html), a <a href="freepsxboot-exploit.html">flashed memory card</a>, a <a href="save-game-exploit.html">save game exploit</a>, a <a href="boot-cd.html">CD-R</a>, or even a <a href="gameshark-code.html">GameShark Code</a>. The Tonyhax International loader provides the ability to properly play backup CD-R and ‘imported region discs’ on all PS1 consoles, and all supported early PS2 consoles (Japanese, USA, and PAL models SCPH-10000-SCPH-39004).</p>
<p>If you are using <strong>any Japanese console</strong>, at least one real Japanese NTSC-J PS1 game disc is required (any officially licensed Japanese PS1 disc will do). If you are using a <strong>Japanese PS2 console (SCPH-10000-SCPH-39000)</strong> a Swap Magic Tool is also required. Neither of these are needed if you are using an American or European PS1/PS2 console.</p>
<h3 id="japanese-ps1-console-loader-instructions">Japanese PS1 Console Loader Instructions</h3>
<p>Start the Tonyhax International loader with a supported boot method:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="gameshark-code.html">GameShark Code</a></li>
<li><a href="flashed-cheat-cart.html">ROM/ROM Flasher CD</a></li>
<li><a href="freepsxboot-exploit.html">FreePSXBoot Memory Card Images</a></li>
<li><a href="boot-cd.html">Boot CD</a></li>
<li><a href="save-game-exploit.html">Save Game Exploit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you see the text <code>Put in a real NTSC-J PSX game disc, then block the lid sensor</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the CD drive of your PS1 console.</li>
<li>Put in a real NTSC-J Japanese PS1 game disc in the CD drive, but don’t close the CD drive lid.</li>
<li>The lid sensor is highlighted by the red circle and arrow in the pictures below. On the original grey fat PS1 consoles (SCPH-900X and earlier) it is located in the top right corner, it is is shaped like a circle. Ideally you press it down with a bent pen spring as shown. On the slim PSone consoles (SCPH-10X) it is in the lower right corner to the side of the edge of the CD drive. For these consoles it is best to use a piece of tape or paper to slide in and press it down as shown.</li>
</ul>

<p>After blocking the lid sensor, your real Japanese PS1 game will spin up and then stop. Once you see the text <code>Put in a backup/import disc, then press X</code> remove either the real NTSC-J PSX game disc or Boot CD from your PS1 console’s CD drive. Put in the backup CD-R or import PSX game disc you want to play <strong>without unblocking the lid sensor</strong>. Once you press X, the console will run some commands automatically, followed by the game booting with perfect CD audio playback. Note that you can not unblock the lid sensor while playing the game on <strong>Japanese consoles</strong>, if you do so the game will stop working.</p>
<h3 id="playing-games-that-span-multiple-discs-on-japanese-ps1-consoles">Playing Games That Span Multiple Discs On Japanese PS1 Consoles</h3>
<p>There are some games which span multiple discs. And some of these games (such as Parasite Eve, Fear Effect, and Crono Cross) that span multiple discs require you to open the CD drive, remove disc 1, insert disc 2, and close the CD drive at some point in the game without providing a save game option at the disc swap. If you encounter this type of game on a Japanese PS1 console you have to do the “mid-game hot-swap trick”:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the game asks you to insert disc 2, unblock the lid sensor and remove the CD.</li>
<li>Put <strong>any real authentic Japanese PSX disc</strong> into the PS1 drive.</li>
<li>You will now be performing a <em>mid-game hot-swap trick</em>. Have the disc 2 you want to play in one hand, and whatever your using to block the lid sensor in another. Now block the lid sensor, freeing your one hand. Wait until the original real Japanese PSX disc stats spinning fast (~3 seconds) and <strong>immediately</strong> swap the disc with your free hand, and put in the actual disc 2 you want to play. You can now continue playing your game that spans multiple discs normally! This trick would work for games that span even more then 2 discs as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note however that most games that span multiple discs allow you to load a game save created on disc 1 while playing disc 2. This means you just need to save at the last point possible on disc 1, and then you can just boot disc 2 like normal and load your game save created earlier on disc 1. <strong>Some games however do not allow this</strong> as previously mentioned, so for those games you must use the <strong>mid-game hot-swap trick</strong> described above.</p>
<h3 id="japanese-ps2-console-loader-instructions">Japanese PS2 Console Loader Instructions</h3>
<p>Start the Tonyhax International loader with a supported boot method:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="boot-cd.html">Boot CD</a> (I don’t know of anyway to boot this on an unmodified Japanese PS2 but it is available).</li>
<li><a href="save-game-exploit.html">Save game exploit</a></li>
<li><a href="gameshark-code.html">GameShark Code</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Japanese PS2 consoles <strong>must have the DVD drive tray front panel removed to use Tonyhax International</strong>. For the SCPH-10000, you can follow the method below (some newer consoles may slightly differ in the way to remove the DVD drive’s front panel).</p>
<h3 id="removing-the-dvd-drive-tray-front-panel">Removing The DVD Drive Tray Front Panel</h3>
<p>Turn on the Japanese PS2 console. Eject the DVD drive tray, and <strong>while it is open</strong> power off the console by either pulling the plug from the wall or PSU in the back of the console, or by flicking the power switch for the PSU on the back of the console. You can not use the power button because then the DVD drive tray will close before the console turns off. Now, flip the Japanese PS2 console upside down like in the image below:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/ps2-upside-down.jpg" alt="ps2 upside down" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">ps2 upside down</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now bring your focus to the bottom of the opened DVD drive tray. At the very top edge (highlighted in the picture above) is a tab. You want to jam a thin flat head screwdriver in between this tab and the DVD drive tray face plate as shown in the image below. Now, push with the flat head screwdriver to separate the DVD drive face plate from the rest of the DVD drive tray. <strong>Be very gentle and only use a direct straight force towards the face plate. Do not go side to side when doing this or you risk breaking off an edge of the DVD drive tray. I am obviously not responsible for any damage you may do by doing this!</strong> Once successful, the face plate will become removable. You are free to slide it back on at a later time, it just needs to be off for you to use the Japanese PS2 to boot backup/import PS1 games with Tonyhax International.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/ps2-drive-tab.jpg" alt="ps2 drive tab" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">ps2 drive tab</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With the DVD drive face plate off, flip over the Japanese PS2 console right side up. You can now see a gap at the bottom of the DVD drive. This is where you place the Swap Magic Tool in when using Tonyhax International on your Japanese PS2 console.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/ps2-drive-cover-removed.jpg" alt="ps2 drive cover removed" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">ps2 drive cover removed</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can now use one of the supported boot methods to start the Tonyhax International loader on the Japanese PS2 console. You will most likely be using the <a href="save-game-exploit.html">Save Game Exploit</a>, however you could be using some kind of intermediate boot disc to boot the <a href="boot-cd.html">Boot CD</a> as well if you find one that supports Japanese PS1 consoles. Once you see the text <code>Put in a backup/import disc, then press X</code> appear, you need to use a Swap Magic Slide Tool to release the DVD drive to gain access to it without pressing the eject switch. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ffv5m52zlEI">video tutorial</a> is available that shows how to use the Swap Magic Tool (in general), although the exact steps are also explained below. Once you use the Swap Magic Tool to swap in your import/backup CD-R while booted in the Tonyhax International loader, just press the cross button on your PS2 or PS1 controller to boot and play your game.</p>
<p>Important note: <strong>do not eject the PS1 import or backup CD-R from the Japanese PS2 console until your done playing the game</strong>. Unlike American and European consoles (which do not have this limitation), if you do so your game will stop working, and you will have to start Tonyhax International all over again to boot your import/backup CD-R and start playing again.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-swap-magic-tool">Using the Swap Magic Tool</h3>
<p>Slide in the Swap Magic Tool like shown in the image below by the arrow. You need to feel around with the Swap Magic Tool to get the hook to latch on internally inside the DVD drive.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/ps2-insert-slide-tool.jpg" alt="ps2 insert slide tool" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">ps2 insert slide tool</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now that your Swap Magic Tool is latched on internally inside the DVD drive, move it straight to the right side. This movement will feel correct and nice when you are properly using the Swap Magic Tool, reassuring you are using it correctly. Once you get to the end of this movement the DVD drive tray will begin to move forward out of the DVD drive, “releasing” it from it’s locked state.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/ps2-slide-tool-moved-to-release-drive.jpg" alt="ps2 slide tool moved to release drive" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">ps2 slide tool moved to release drive</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Use your hand to pull out the DVD drive tray to gain access to the disc in it. Remove the original NTSC-J PSX game disc, and put in your import/backup CD-R.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/ps2-drive-released.jpg" alt="ps2 drive released" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">ps2 drive released</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With your import/backup CD-R in the Japanese PS2 console, use your hand to push in the DVD drive tray as far as it will go back into the DVD drive.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/ps2-push-in-released-drive.jpg" alt="ps2 push in released drive" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">ps2 push in released drive</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now that the DVD drive tray is pushed all the way back in, the Swap Magic Tool can be used to “lock” the drive. Like before, slide in the Swap Magic Tool to the right most position like shown in the image below. Remember to feel around with the Swap Magic Tool to get the hook to latch on internally inside the DVD drive. Now that your Swap Magic Tool is once again latched on internally inside the DVD drive, move it straight to the left side. This movement will feel correct and nice when you are properly using the Swap Magic Tool, reassuring you are using it correctly. Once you get to the end of this movement (when you can’t go any more to the left) the DVD drive tray will fully go back inside the DVD drive to put the DVD drive into the “locked” state.</p>

<h3 id="playing-games-that-span-multiple-discs-on-japanese-ps2-consoles">Playing Games That Span Multiple Discs on Japanese PS2 Consoles</h3>
<p>There are some games which span multiple discs. And <strong>some of these games</strong> (such as Parasite Eve, Fear Effect, and Crono Cross) that span multiple discs require you to open the CD drive, remove disc 1, insert disc 2, and close the CD drive at some point in the game. <strong>Unfortunately only for Japanese PS2 consoles, you can not do this with Tonyhax International.</strong> If you get to a point in a game that requires ejecting the drive and putting in a new game, you have to play this part of the game on a different console (Any PS1 or American/European PS2 works). It is important to note however that most games that span multiple discs allow you to load a game save created on disc 1 while playing disc 2. This means you just need to save at the last point possible on disc 1, and then you can just boot disc 2 with Tonyhax International like normal and load your game save created earlier on disc 1, bypassing this limitation for certain games that allow saving right at disc swap mid-game.</p>
<h3 id="playing-pal-region-games-on-japanese-ps2-consoles">Playing PAL Region Games On Japanese PS2 Consoles</h3>
<p>The early PS2 models that Tonyhax International supports have the PS1 mode which runs PS1 software hard-coded to NTSC video mode. This can cause a problem with Tonyhax International if you want to play a European/PAL PS1 backup CD-R or import disc on a Japanese PS2 in PAL video mode. Since PS1 software can not change the video mode correctly from PS1 mode running on a PS2, you have to resort to the <strong>PS2 homebrew software known as <a href="https://www.psx-place.com/threads/ps1vmodeneg-by-sp193.25050/">PSVModeNeg</a></strong>. This software allows you to explicitly change the video mode to PAL. An older version of PSVModeNeg is required if you want to use it’s effects with Tonyhax International, specifically <a href="https://alex-free.github.io/tonyhax-international/PS1VModeNeg-1.0.1.zip">v1.0.1</a>. This version simply inverses the current video mode of the console, rather then reading the PS1 game disc to figure out what video mode the disc itself expects. Here are the steps below to change your Japanese PS2 console to PAL video mode for Tonyhax International:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download <a href="https://alex-free.github.io/tonyhax-international/PS1VModeNeg-1.0.1.zip">PSVModeNeg v1.0.1</a> and extract the file <code>PS1VModeNeg.elf</code>.</li>
<li>Copy the file <code>PS1VModeNeg.elf</code> to a FAT32 formatted USB flash drive that works with your soft-modded PS2. You can soft-mod your PS2 with <a href="https://www.ps2-home.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5208">FreeHDBoot</a>, <a href="https://github.com/CTurt/FreeDVDBoot">FreeDVDBoot</a> or <a href="https://www.ps2-home.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1248">FreeMCBoot</a> to be able to use PS1VModeNEG on your PS2 console.</li>
<li>Using uLaunchELF or wLaunchELF load the <code>PS1VModeNeg.elf</code> file from the <code>mass</code> device (your flash drive).</li>
<li>Put in the real Japanese PS1 game disc that you are using with a <a href="save-game-exploit.html">save game exploit.</a> when in PS1VModeNeg. The video mode will be forced to PAL now in the PS1 mode of your Japanese PS2.</li>
<li>Playing through your Japanese PS1 game disc may look or act weird in PAL video mode, ignore this. Just get to the exploit method and start Tonyhax International. Put in a PAL region import disc or PAL region backup CD-R and the PAL PS1 game will boot in PAL video mode.</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="boot-cd.html">Boot CD</a></li>
<li><a href="save-game-exploit.html">Save Game Exploit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you see the text <code>Put in a backup/import disc</code> appear, eject the DVD drive (PS2) or open the CD drive (PS1).</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are booting the Tonyhax International <a href="boot-cd.html">Boot CD</a>, you’ll want to remove the spring or whatever you have blocking down the lid sensor to “open” the CD drive and stop the disc from spinning, allowing you to remove the Boot CD from the console’s CD drive (PS1) or DVD drive (PS2).</li>
<li>If you are booting Tonyhax International via a <a href="save-game-exploit.html">Save Game Exploit</a>, after ejecting the DVD drive (PS2) or opening the CD drive (PS1) the real PS1 game disc you used with a save game exploit will stop spinning, allowing you to remove it from the console’s CD drive (PS1) or DVD drive (PS2).</li>
</ul>
<p>All other boot methods don’t have a disc usually in the drive already, so there is no disc to remove. With no disc currently in your console, you can now put in the backup CD-R or import PSX game disc you want to play. Close the CD drive (PS1) or DVD drive (PS2). The console will detect that the drive has been closed and will spin up your disc. The console will then send some commands and boot the disc.</p>

<h2 id="cd-r-media-for-psx-backups">CD-R Media For PSX Backups</h2>
<p><strong>Only use high-quality CD-R media for PSX backups.</strong> If you want good results burning backups for your PS1 your CD-R media should contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>High quality dye (SuperAZO, AZO, or Phthalocyanine).</li>
<li>A highly reflective layer system.</li>
<li>High quality polycarbonate and “sealing” process combining all parts of the CD-R.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ideally, you want to use 74 minute discs</em>. The PSX was never designed for the now more common 80 minute discs, and it is easier for the laser to track 74 minute discs due to their wider data spiral track. As of 2023, 74 minute discs are not really manufactured anymore and new old stock can get pricey, so it really may not be worth it as the PSX can read 80 minute discs fine. It just can read 74 minute discs easier as that is closer to what it was designed for originally (which was 72 minute pressed CD-ROMs).</p>
<p>I have found Verbatim DataLifePlus CD-Rs to be really good with PS1 consoles. Here is the ATIP information displayed by <code>cdrecord -atip</code> for a Verbatim DataLifePlus CD-R:</p>
<pre><code>ATIP info from disk:
  Indicated writing power: 4
Disk Is not unrestricted
Disk Is not erasable
  Disk sub type: Medium Type A, high Beta category (A+) (3)
  ATIP start of lead in:  -11077 (97:34/23)
  ATIP start of lead out: 359848 (79:59/73)
Disk type:    Long strategy type (Cyanine, AZO or similar)
Manuf. index: 11
Manufacturer: Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation</code></pre>
<p>Verbatim UltraLife Archival Grade Gold CD-Rs also are really good, although they are more expensive then Verbatim DataLifePlus. I think Verbatim DataLifePlus CD-Rs are slightly better with the PS1 as well, but they are an option. Here is the ATIP information displayed by <code>cdrecord -atip</code> for a Verbatim DataLifePlus CD-R:</p>
<pre><code>ATIP info from disk:
  Indicated writing power: 5
Disk Is not unrestricted
Disk Is not erasable
  Disk sub type: Medium Type B, low Beta category (B-) (4)
  ATIP start of lead in:  -12520 (97:15/05)
  ATIP start of lead out: 359849 (79:59/74)
Disk type:    Short strategy type (Phthalocyanine or similar)
Manuf. index: 26
Manufacturer: TDK Corporation</code></pre>
<p><strong>Do not use cheap/poor quality CD-R media, which is almost always all that is available in retail stores and most likely any CD-R that is not “archival grade”</strong>. Poor quality cheap CD-R media <em>can</em> result in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slower loading times/in-game lag because of CD drive tracking errors (bad noises from the CD drive).</li>
<li>Issues reading data off of the disc possibly resulting in a game to freeze and motor power off in the CD drive.</li>
<li>Skipping/silent audio and or music.</li>
</ul>
<p>Later PS1 consoles (starting at the SCPH-5000 series and newer) and all PS2 consoles have a much greater tolerance to poor quality CD-R media, and <em>may</em> work fine with it however in general it is still best to just always use Verbatim DataLifePlus/UltraLife CD-Rs or something of similar quality. Here is the ATIP information displayed by <code>cdrecord -atip</code> for a Maxell Music CD-R (which is a poor quality brand/CD-R media that is <strong>highly not recommended</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are having issues booting discs in Tonyhax International, consider wiping with a clean microfiber cloth from the inner ring to the outer edge of the disc in all directions and then trying to boot the disc again.</p>
<h2 id="building-from-source">Building From Source</h2>
<p>Obtain the <strong>complete Tonyhax International current source tree from GitHub using git</strong>, using the command below:</p>
<p><code>git clone --recursive https://github.com/alex-free/tonyhax</code></p>
<p>Next, install all the required dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>git</li>
<li>autoconf</li>
<li>automake</li>
<li>g++</li>
<li>make</li>
<li>libtool</li>
<li>texinfo</li>
<li>help2man</li>
<li>ncurses-devel</li>
<li>libtinyxml2-devel</li>
<li>cmake</li>
<li>cdrdao</li>
<li>python</li>
<li>pandoc</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running <em>Fedora or Debian</em> (Windows Subsystem For Linux can run these operating systems on Windows to provide a sufficient build environment), you can download the build dependencies automatically with the <code>get-deps.sh</code> script found in the <code>scripts</code> folder of the Tonyhax International <a href="https//alex-free.github.io/tonyhax">source tree</a>. <strong>For any other OS, you’ll need to find the above packages and install them manually yourself.</strong></p>
<p>Next, you need to build the tool-chain. Execute the <code>build-tool-chain.sh</code> script, which is found in the <code>scripts</code> directory of the source tree. <strong>This will take some time to build, depending on how fast your computer is.</strong></p>
<p>After that, build mkpsxsiso. Execute the <code>build-mkpsxiso.sh</code> script, which is found in the <code>scripts</code> directory of the source tree.</p>
<p>With everything installed, you can now build Tonyhax International with the <code>build.sh</code> script found in the <code>scripts</code> directory of the Tonyhax International source tree. After you build Tonyhax International a release <code>.zip</code> file will be generated in the root of the source directory.</p>

His results have confirmed that the video mode can not be changed from PS1 software in PS1 mode on a PS1. It must be changed in PS1DRV from the PS2, as PS1 mode is set to always display the same video mode that the console shipped with (for the early PS2s that Tonyhax International supports). He mentioned that PS1VModeNeg v1.0.1 can be used to overcome this.
