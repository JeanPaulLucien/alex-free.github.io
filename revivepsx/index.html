<h1>Revive PSX - The Definitive Guide Of Refurbishing, Maintaining, and Fixing PS1 CD Drives</h1>

<i>By Alex Free</i>

<h2>Does your PS1:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Only read original PS1 game discs, and not backup CD-Rs even when using a soft-mod method like <a href=https://alex-free.github.io/tonyhax-international>Tonyhax International</a>?</li>

    <li>Boot games very slow (the white and black Sony license screens stay on screen for an abnormal amount of time before booting the game on startup)?</li>

    <li>Only read discs if you turn the entire console vertical or upside down?</li>

    <li>Show Loading screens in games longer then usual (with audible seek/tracking errors coming from the CD drive)?</li>

    <li>Experience stuttering or lag in games that steam a lot of data off of the disc?</li>

    <li>Experience sudden cut-out/silence of CD audio playback in games?</li>

    <li>Experience FMV stuttering or complete FMV playback failure (black screen, video stops)?</li>

    <li>CD Drive constantly gets 'lost' trying to track the CD, sometimes causing runoff where the laser sled seeks all the way to the end of the disc before possibly completely 'giving up' reading the disc entirely?.</li>

    <li>CD Drive get very loud, 'clicks', rattles, and otherwise just sounds terrible/rough?</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Then this guide is written for you!</b> The goal of this guide is to describe the complete method I personally use to address <b>sub-optimal performance in PlayStation CD Drives, the main cause of poor disc reading in PS1 optical drives. Simpy addressing this can fix all of the issues above if nothing is physically wrong with the CD drive in your PlayStation console. Below I will explain how to address the above issues with specific maintenance techniques I use when getting a new to me PS1 CD drive.

<h2>The Tools</h2>

<p>This guide requires quite a few things to complete it. Before continuing you should have:</p>

<ul>
    <li>At least 2 clean, fine-tip, thin, and very small paintbrushes. One for applying new white lithium grease, the other for cleaning off the old existing grease already in the CD drive.</li>
    <li>At least 2 clean toothbrushes. One for applying new white lithium grease, the other for cleaning off the old existing grease already in the CD drive.</li>
    <li>A tube of white lithium grease.</li>
    <li>A bottle of synthetic light clock oil with a funnel top.</li>
    <li>A can of WD-40 to clean out the spindle and laser sled motors. If you can get one with a tube connected to the sprayer that is ideal. If you can't get that then you can substitute a funnel with a damp Q-TIP soaked in WD-40 that will be dabbed to provide the same affect.</li>
    <li>A bowl of clean water to rinse out and or improve grease removal for the toothbrush or paintbrush.</li>
    <li>A bowl of soapy water to dip a toothbrush or paintbrush in to better remove any old grease from the CD drive.</li>
    <li>A pack of Q-TIPs for blocking the exposed lid sensor and removing any excessive liquid you will be applying to various parts of the CD drive.</li>
    <li>A <code>flathead #2 screwdriver</code> for modifying the Bias and Gain (only required for SCPH-1000/SCPH-1001/SCPH-1002/SCPH-3000/SCPH-3500).</li>
    <li>A <code>Phillips #00 screwdriver</code> for removing the 2 screws connecting the CD drive top case to the rest of the CD drive.</li>
    <li>A <code>Phillips #1 screwdriver</code> for removing the 5 bottom screws of the PlayStation.</li>
    <li>Paper towels.</li>
    <li>A clean high thread count microfiber cloth for cleaning off the laser lens at the end.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cleaning All Moving Parts</h2>

<p>The first thing to do is to remove and strip all the original lubrication from the CD drive. Any original lubrication in a PS1 CD drive has long since lost it's ability to provide enough frictionless movement for the laser sled and spindle motor to operate optimally at this point in time due to the sheer age of the hardware itself. In order to do this, we need to completely remove the CD drive itself from the console. Once the CD drive is removed, the CD drive top case can then be removed as well giving access to every lubrication point in the CD drive.</p>

<p>To remove the CD drive from the console, you must first do one specific task while the PlayStation is all assembled:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Connect the console up, put in an Audio CD, and power it on.</li>
  <li>Using the PlayStation CD Player play the audio track that is in the middle of the audio CD. I.e., if your audio CD has 18 tracks, play track 9. If you have an odd amount of tracks, divide by 2 and round up (i.e. for 19 tracks play track 10). While the audio is playing, power off the PlayStation console. This will 'lock' the laser sled around the halfway point of the laser sled rails, allowing you to remove the CD drive top case later.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that the laser sled is in the right position, unplug any memory cards, remove the audio CD in the CD drive, and remove the power and video cables from the Playstation console. Flip the entire console upside down so that the model sticker is visible. Unscrew the 5 <code>Phillips #1</code> screws on the bottom of the PlayStation console. After all screws are removed flip the PlayStation back over right side up. Take off the top case of the console by simply raising it off of the lower base, exposing the CD drive/motherboard.</p>

<p><img src="final-images/1-scph-1000-lower-case.jpg" alt="scph-1000 lower case" height="400"></p>

<p>There are 2 different cables connecting the PS1 CD drive to the motherboard. The first one addressed is the laser ribbon cable, which is wide, thin, and red/orange. It is secured with a locking connector on the motherboard. Gently pull up on the left 'wing' of the locking socket, and then do the same to the right 'wing' on the right side of the locking socket. This will fully unlock the connector and release the laser ribbon cable. The laser ribbon cable can now be pulled gently out of the locking socket exposing it's contacts.</p></p>

<p>The second cable is what I dub the 'power wires'. They are the thin multicolored group of wires connecting to a socket on the CD drive itself. Gently pull the power wires away from the socket on the CD drive itself to remove them, finally freeing the CD drive itself.</p>

<p>Unscrew the 2 <code>Phillips #00</code> screws on each side of the spindle motor which secure CD drive top case to the rest of the CD drive. Once these screws are removed, push the CD drive's top case forward (away from the spindle motor). Once it slides over the CD drive a bit forward, start pushing diagonally away from the spindle motor and to the right. The CD drive top case should just slide right out, exposing the CD drive's internals.</p>




<p>The spindle motor (the motor that spins the CD) can loose it's original lubrication over time and or the motor gears/internals can become dirty. This can cause:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Audible 'rattling' when spinning a CD, which may be worse during disc read speed changes (i.e. 2x to 1x or 1x to 2x) and or at higher disc read speeds in general (at 2x).</li>
    <li>The spindle will react to disc read speed changes (i.e. 2x to 1x or 1x to 2x) slower causes tracking issues with the laser sled due to miscalculation of where the laser spindle thinks the expected data is on a spinning disc.</li>
    <li>The spindle motor may turn too slow to keep up with the expected seek distance and time calibrations expected by the PlayStation Servo, especially apparent at high disc read speeds (2x).</li>
    <li>Uneven spindle motor spinning may cause too much "play" in the vertical (up and down) movement of the spinning disc while the laser sled is tracking the spinning disc.</li>
</ul>

<p>By cleaning out what remains of the original spindle motor lubrication and any gunk left in the internals and then re-lubricating the spindle motor internals with high quality oil you can address all of the above issues as long as the spindle motor is not internally damaged (which it most likely is not!)</p>

<p><b>To clean out</b> the spindle motor, it is recommend to put a small amount of <b>WD-40</b> into the various access holes at the bottom of the spindle motor itself using a very small funnel. The important thing to remember is you need to start out very small in the amount of initial WD-40. Once some initial liquid is inside the spindle motor internals, keep the entire CD Drive assembly upside down, propped up at the top side (where the laser sled goes to when reading the end of a CD) to let the WD-40 really seep in to all of the gears and clean them out. Every 10 minutes for the next hour you should spin the spindle motor (from where a CD normally goes on) manually a few times to keep the WD-40 moving around inside the spindle motor and to prevent it from only working in one part of the spindle motor.</p>

<p><b>To lubricate</b> the spindle motor, it is recommend to put a small amount of <b>synthetic light clock oil not containing any preservatives</b>. You should ideally buy some that includes an optional small funnel top that can be screwed on to the oil bottle so that you can squirt some into the spindle motor access holes found on the bottom of the spindle motor. The important thing to remember is you need to start out very small in the amount of initial oil. Once some initial oil is inside the spindle motor internals, keep the entire CD Drive assembly upside down, propped up at the top side (where the laser sled goes to when reading the end of a CD) to let the WD-40 really seep in to all of the gears and clean them out. Every 10 minutes for the next hour you should spin the spindle motor (from where a CD normally goes on) manually a few times to keep the oil moving around inside the spindle motor and to prevent it from only working in one part of the spindle motor.</p>

<p>When your done cleaning and lubricating the spindle motor, clean off any remaining dampness from the bottom (around the access holes). Next, ensure that you have not put too much liquid into the motor by feeling with a Q-TIP/clean dry paintbrush or just by looking for excess liquid coming from the bottom and or top of the spindle motor after gently turning the spindle motor upside-down and right-side up a few times.</p>

<p>If find that you have put an excessive amount of liquid into the spindle motor clean off any visible dampness, manually spin the spindle by hand, and wait as long as it takes for any excessive liquid to leave the internals of the spindle motor before proceeding.</p>

<p>After doing this, move on to the laser sled motor. Keep in mind however that if at the end you still hear jerk/rattling in the spindle motor that you should probably put a little bit more oil into the spindle motor access holes and repeat that step to lubricate it a bit more.</p>

<a name=lasermotor><h2>Step 2 : Laser Sled Motor</h2></a>

<p>The laser sled motor is what turns all of the plastic gears which move the laser sled up and down the length of the PlayStation CD Drive. It is located on the right side of the CD Drive. It is much smaller and harder to access then then the spindle motor. If it is not properly lubricated and or dirty it can cause many similar issues as a sub-optimal <a href=#spindle>spindle motor</a>.</p>

<p>Give the laser sled motor the same treatment as the spindle motor, ideally use half as much WD-40 and light clock oil due to it's size and the fact that you can not really spin it manually so you should really go easy on the amount of liquid you use.</p>

<a name=#lasersled><h2>Step 3 : Laser Sled Motor Gears & Rails</h2></a>

<p>Before you can continue, you <b>must <a href=#removecddrivetopcase>remove</a> the top case of the CD drive</b>.</p>

<p>The laser sled motor gears are all of the white plastic gears that connect the <a name=lasermotor>laser sled motor</a> to the laser sled. <b>To clean the laser sled motor gears</b> remove all of the existing grease (or what remains of it) needs to be scrubbed off of the gears. The tool of choice with this is a clean toothbrush dipped in water. Use a clean toothbrush dabbed in water to brush off the old grease from all of the white gears, get in the teeth and crevices of all white gearing pieces, all the sides you have access to with the CD Drive top case removed. Don't forget to flip the CD drive upside down to get to the other side of the first laser sled motor gear attached to the laser sled motor directly. Once you thoroughly clean out the gearing go over the gears with a clean dry toothbrush to get rid of any excess water.</p>

<p>The laser sled rails are what the laser sled (the metal piece in the middle the houses the laser diode itself) moves on. There is a rail on the left and a rail on the right side of each CD drive. <b>To start cleaning the laser sled rails</b> Use a clean very small fine tip paintbrush dipped in water to clean off the existing grease on all areas of the rails that the laser sled rides on that you can currently access. Some of the area is blocked by the laser sled itself, we will get to that later. You want to clean the top, side/middle, and bottom parts of the rails. You can access the <b>top side of the rails</b> immediately after removing the top case of a PS1 CD drive. To access the <b>middle of the rails</b> angle your wet paintbrush and get the inner-most edges which are facing the laser sled. To access the <b>bottom of the rails</b> flip the entire CD Drive upside down.</p>

<p>Be very careful to not use <b>too much water</b>, and of getting any electrical hardware of the CD Drive wet (dry it off ASAP if this happens). Wait 30 minutes or so to let the gears completely dry. If you encounter really stuck grease, you can try a paintbrush soaked in lightly soaped water or just use the dull end of a plastic pick or applicator to very lightly scrape at stuck grease blobs to break them up (but don't scrap the laser sled rails themselves!).</p>

<p>With the gears dried, <a href=#reconnectcddrivetopcase>reconnect</a> the top case of the CD Drive lid.</a> <a href=reconnectcddrive>Reconnect</a> the CD drive to the PlayStation. Slide the top case of the PlayStation console back on top of the bottom half, but don't screw the console top case back on just yet as we will be taking it off and on a few times in the rest of this guide.</p>

<p>Place an audio CD or a PS1 game containing CD audio (backup or real PS1 disc both work for this) on the exposed CD drive's spindle. Close the CD drive lid, it should make the disc spin up and display the audio tracks. Take the total amount of audio tracks (i.e. 18) and divide it in half (i.e. 9). Play that track. If you audio CD has an uneven total of audio tracks simply round up or down at your discretion. Play the audio track in the middle of the CD and while the audio is playing power off the console.</p>

<p>Next press the eject button to open the PlayStation console's top case and remove the CD. With the CD removed you can completely take off the top case of the PlayStation console which should still be unscrewed and unsecured to the bottom half at this point in the guide.</p>

<p><a href=#removecddrive>Remove</a> the CD drive once again. Once it is not connected to the console <a href=#removecddrivetopcase>remove</a> the CD drive top case as well. You will now notice that the laser sled is in a slightly different position along the laser sled rails which is closer to the spindle motor. There still should be enough room to remove the CD drive top case however.</p>

<p>With the CD drive top case once again removed, you can now access parts of the rails previously covered/blocked by the laser sled itself. <b>Finish cleaning the newly exposed area of the laser sled rails</b> the same way you previously did. You can now also access just a bit more of the teeth in the laser rail guide (the long piece of plastic gearing on top of the right rail connected by the white gears to the laser sled motor). <b>Finish cleaning the laser sled motor gears</b> by going over it again with a clean toothbrush dabbed in water to reach any teeth or areas you couldn't previously. Use a dry toothbrush to dry off any water on the white plastic gears.</p>

<p>Again, be very careful to not use <b>too much water</b>, and of getting any electrical hardware of the CD Drive wet (dry it off ASAP if this happens). Wait 30 minutes or so to let the gears completely dry. If you encounter really stuck grease, you can try a paintbrush soaked in lightly soaped water or just use a pick to very lightly scrape at stuck grease blobs to break them up (but not at the rails themselves!).</p>

<p>Congratulations, your CD drive should now be 100% not lubricated and ready for some brand new white lithium grease to be applied!</p>

<p><b>To lubricate the laser sled motor gears</b> first squirt some white lithium grease onto a clean toothbrush. Brush the laser sled motor gears (don't forget to flip the CD drive upside-down to get the gearing connecting the laser sled motor to the laser sled motor gears on the bottom!). Don't go crazy and have excess chunks around the gears, but get everything coated decently and all your bases will be covered.</p>

<p><b>To lubricate the laser sled rails</b> Squirt some white lithium grease on a clean very small fine tip paint brush and paint the grease through all contact points you can access that the laser sled rides on. Get all sides decently coated, just like you did when cleaning the laser sled rails previously. Don't leave excess blobs of grease in the rails however and wipe of any grease that gets on other components of the CD drive.</p>

<p>Next you need <a href=#reconnectcddrivetopcase>reconnect</a> the CD drive top case and <a href=#reconnectcddrive>reconnect</a> the CD drive itself. Once again, put on the top case of the PlayStation console but don't screw it into the bottom half. Put an audio CD or a PS1 game containing CD audio onto the CD drive spindle and close the PlayStation top case.</p>

<p>Place an audio CD or a PS1 game containing CD audio (backup or real PS1 disc both work for this) on the exposed CD drive's spindle. Close the CD drive lid, it should make the disc spin up and display the audio tracks. Play the <b>last</b> audio track in the middle of the CD and while the audio is playing power off the console.</p>

<p>Next press the eject button to open the PlayStation console's top case and remove the CD. With the CD removed you can completely take off the top case of the PlayStation console which should still be unscrewed and unsecured to the bottom half at this point in the guide.</p>

<p><a href=#removecddrive>Remove</a> the CD drive once again. Once it is not connected to the console <a href=#removecddrivetopcase>remove</a> the CD drive top case as well. You will now notice that the laser sled is in a slightly different position along the laser sled rails which is closer to the spindle motor. There still should be enough room to remove the CD drive top case however.</p>

<p>With the CD drive top case once again removed, you can now access parts of the rails previously covered/blocked by the laser sled itself. <b>Finish cleaning the laser sled rails</b> by going over the areas previously covered by the laser sled with the paint brush of white lithium greases. Take a toothbrush of white lithium grease and go over parts of the laser sled guide rail (the long plastic gearing piece on the right) to get to teeth you previously did not have access to.</p>

<p>Finally <a href=#reconnectcddrivetopcase>reconnect</a> the CD drive top case for hopefully the last time in this refurbishment. <a href=#reconnectcddrive>Reconnect</a> the CD drive to the console. If you have a SCPH-1000, SCPH-1001, SCPH-1002, SCPH-3000, or SCPH-3500 console proceed to step 4 below. If you have a SCPH-5000 or newer console you are actually ready to test out your refurbishment and should go to <a href=#testing>step 7</a> at this point.</p>

<a name=biasngain><h2>Step 4 : Manual Bias & Gain Adjustments (Early Consoles Only)</h2></a>

 <p>On the early SCPH-1000/SCPH-3000/SCPH-3500/SCPH-1001/SCPH-1002 consoles the bias and gain values are not automatically adjusted by the PS1 motherboard like on all newer PS1 console revisions. They are manually set by the bias screw and the gain screw. When you get a new CD drive connected the bias and gain values may change from what they should be, or you may find that the CD drive does not work as well as it can without slight adjustments to these values. If you measure the bias value to not be 1.634v in standby (no CD in drive/drive open), and if the gain value is not around 1.825v measured while playing CD audio, consider changing them to these values IF simply modifying the laser resistance screw does not do enough.</p>

<h2>Step 5 : Checking Bias & Gain Values (Early Consoles Only)</h2>

<p>Start with the PlayStation console powered on with the CD drive connected, but with no disc on the CD Drive spindle. Leave the lid sensor unblocked. The console is in 'idle' like this. Using a multi-meter set to measure voltage, connect the positive lead to the <code>Bias</code> point (as displayed in the image below) and the negative lead to anywhere on the top metal shielding of the PS1 console found under the CD drive to ground the Bias point. The voltage value your multi-meter displays while your console is in 'idle' is the <code>Bias</code> value your motherboard is currently set to.</p>

<p>Go into the CD Player on the console. Place an audio CD or a PS1 game containing CD audio (backup or real PS1 disc both work for this) on the exposed CD drive's spindle. Press down the lid sensor at the top right of the exposed lower case of the PlayStation console. This is a black switch lever-type button when the top case of the console is removed). To block the lid sensor, you need to push this lever down (gently) and keep it down. A blob of thick tape can work, as can a very small specifically sized object (such as a Q-TIP-half cut into a specific sized piece). Try different things until you can reliably keep the lid sensor blocked.</b></p>

<p>Keep the negative lead grounded on the metal shield found around the motherboard and below the installed CD drive. Play any audio track on the CD. While the audio is playing put the positive lead of your multi-meter back on the BIAS point. The voltage reading will have slighly changed, this is your <code>Gain</code> value.</p>

<p>The correct value I use for all early PS1 consoles that have manual Bias and Gain adjustments on the motherboard is BIAS: 1.634v GAIN: 1.825v. This value was taken from a SCPH-1000 I own which was sent in for repair to Sony long ago. I am guessing this from a sticker on the bottom dating a repair was made. In any case these values seem optimal for all early consoles.</p>

<p>Many places online constantly state that the Bias should be 1.7v and the Gain should be 1.82v. This info is mostly coming from this website: <a href=http://dogbreath.de/PS1/LaserAlignment/Laser.html>http://dogbreath.de/PS1/LaserAlignment/Laser.html</a>. In my experience, the Bias value of 1.7v is too high. It seems to make it harder for the laser sled to track spinning discs, and can make drive runoff happen (which is when the laser sled seeks all the way out to the end of a spinning disc and gives up reading the disc altogether). So I do not personally recommend this Bias and Gain value combination.</p>

<p>PS1 consoles from the factory seem to have a Bias value of 1.590v and a Gain value of 1.820v.</p>

<h2>Step 6 : Setting Bias & Gain To Optimal Values (Early Consoles Only)</h2>

 <p>If you do not see the value 1.634v for Bias on your motherboard you can set it yourself. Put the PlayStation in 'idle' state by unblocking the lid sensor and removing the audio CD or PS1 game containing CD audio from the CD Drive spindle. Keep the negative lead of the multi-meter grounded on the metal shield found around the motherboard and below the installed CD drive. Put the positive lead of your multi-meter back on the Bias point. Use a <code>flathead #2 screwdriver</code> to very slightly change the bias screw's position on the motherboard, rotating the screw until you get to that value. Rotate <b>CLOCKWISE to increase the Bias voltage value</b> on the multi-meter. Rotate <b>COUNTER-CLOCKWISE to decrease the Bias voltage value</b> on the multi-meter.</p>

<p>After setting the Bias value, you can set the Gain value. You should still be in the CD Player on the console at this point of the guide. Place an audio CD or a PS1 game containing CD audio (backup or real PS1 disc both work for this) on the exposed CD drive's spindle. Press down the lid sensor at the top right of the exposed lower case of the PlayStation console. This is a black switch lever-type button when the top case of the console is removed). To block the lid sensor, you need to push this lever down (gently) and keep it down. A blob of thick tape can work, as can a very small specifically sized object (such as a Q-TIP-half cut into a specific sized piece). Try different things until you can reliably keep the lid sensor blocked. Keep the negative lead of the multi-meter grounded on the metal shield found around the motherboard and below the installed CD drive. Play any audio track on the CD. While the audio is playing put the positive lead of your multi-meter back on the Bias point. While taking the current Gain voltage reading use a <code>flathead #2 screwdriver</code> to very slightly change the bias screw's position on the motherboard, rotating the screw until you get to that value. <b>Rotate CLOCKWISE to decrease the Gain voltage</b> reading. This is because gain is a value to subtract from the Bias. Rotate <b>COUNTER-CLOCKWISE to increase the Gain voltage</b> reading. This is because gain is a value to subtract from the Bias.</p>

<h2><a name=testing>Step 7 : Testing & Breaking In The New Lubricants</a></h2>

<p>You now what the laser sled to put in some work. You can go to the CD player and play a CD to seek around the beginning of the CD disc (play the first audio track) and the end end of the disc (play the last audio track) to move the laser sled (and the grease) around to start breaking it all in. You should not how the CD drive itself sounds. After everything you've done it should be very quiet for a PS1 CD drive. The laser sled seeking should sound clean and concise (if it does not apply more white lithium grease to the rails, make sure everything has a decent even coat). The spindle motor should not rattle (if it does go back to <a href=#spindle>step 1 and repeat it</a>).</p>

<p>With audio CDs playing well, move on to the big guns and start a game with FMVs and also preferably containing CD audio (such as Dead Or Alive). Put in a decently long play session immediately after. FMVs should not skip. CD audio should not skip.</p>

<p>The ultimate test might be something like playing the game Fear Effect, which has streaming FMV backgrounds during game play and a ton of FMVS. You only need to play these games an hour or 2 to make sure your repairs were successful. Game choice is really up to you.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you have completed the guide</p>
