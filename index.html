<h2>Modified Software</h2>

<a name=leopard_sdl2.0.6><h3><a href=https://github.com/alex-free/leopard_sdl2.0.6>Leopard_SDL2.0.6</a> - Modified SDL2 version 2.0.6 for PowerPC/Intel Mac OS X Leopard</h3></a>

<p>Leopard_SDL2.0.6 is based on SDL2 version 2.0.6, with one of <a href=https://github.com/miniupnp>Thomas Bernard's</a> <a href=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/miniupnp/6de808a8939711fcb856eaa049c18883/raw/61f73ee0a3af0b24fafcc73adfb356462db6d747/SDL2-2.0.6_OSX_105.patch>patches</a> applied and further changes by myself in an attempt to perfect support for Mac OS X Leopard. This SDL version is used to build my <a href=https://github.com/alex-free/sm64ex>SM64EX For Mac OS X Leopard (PPC/Intel)</a> fork when building with SDL2.</p>

<p><a href=https://www.libsdl.org/>SDL</a> and my <a href=https://github.com/alex-free/leopard_sdl2.0.6>fork</a> are both licensed under the Zlib license.</p>

<a name=panther_sdl2><h3><a href=https://github.com/alex-free/panther_sdl2>Panther_SDL2</a> - Modified SDL2 version 2.0.3 for Mac OS X 10.3.9, 10.4, & 10.5</h3></a>

<p>Panther_SDL2 is based on SDL2 version 2.0.3, with one of <a href=https://github.com/miniupnp>Thomas Bernard's</a> <a href=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/miniupnp/26d6e967570e5729a757/raw/1a86f3cdfadbd9b74172716abd26114d9cb115d5/SDL2-2.0.3_OSX_104.patch>patches</a> as a base, and then further hacked on to get even Mac OS X 10.3.9 to work!</p>

<p>Panther_SDL2 is better supported on Panther, Tiger, and Leopard then <a href=https://github.com/alex-free/leopard_sdl2.0.6>Leopard_SDL2.0.6</a> is, but some programs are now requiring APIs only available in SDL 2.0.4 or even newer (like <a href=https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex>SM64EX</a>).</p>

<p>The latest FFplay still supports SDL2 version 2.0.3, and both FFplay and Panther_SDL2 are apart of <a href=https://github.com/alex-free/powerpc-media-center>PowerPC Media Center 7</a>.</p>

<p><a href=https://www.libsdl.org/>SDL</a> and my <a href=https://github.com/alex-free/panther_sdl2>fork</a> are both licensed under the Zlib license.</p>

<a name=pecf><h3><a href=https://alex-free.github.io/pecf>Parasite Eve Credits Disc Read Fail Glitch Fix</a></h3></a>

<p>My fix to allow completing the game and enabling 'EX' mode on PSX consoles that may fail to play the ending credit music.</p>


<a name=ppcmc7><h3><a href=https://alex-free.github.io/ppcmc7/>PowerPC Media Center 7</a> - YouTube/Twitch Streaming, Downloader, Converter, Web Interface, The Latest FFplay, & More For Mac OS X 10.3.9-10.5.8</h3></a>

<p>PowerPC Media Center was in development for years before being discontinued by the original authors 'Hugh Downs' and 'OpenSourceMac' at version 6. When this happened I forked PowerPC Media Center into PowerPC Media Center 7, with a bigger vision, more features, future proofing, and better UX in mind. Since then it has become my most popular project with the most users.</p>

<p>PowerPC Media Center 7 comes with bleeding-edge software depdencies and exciting new features, including an up to date video player with FFplay. Streaming/downloading from your favorite sites such as Twitch, YouTube, and SoundCloud are all still possible in 2021 using this software.</p>

<p>PPCMC7 comes with many dependency programs under thier own respective licenses, but everything else is released into the Public Domain as the former authors did previously with PPCMC version 6.</p>

<h3><a name=sm64ex_leopard><a href=https://github.com/alex-free/sm64ex>SM64EX For Mac OS X Leopard (PPC/Intel)</a> - Super Mario 64 Ported To PowerPC Mac OS X Leopard</a></h3></a>

<p>Turns out I am the first person to release source code modifications that allows the Super Mario 64 port <a href=https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex>SM64EX</a> to run on Mac OS X Leopard PowerPC and Intel! My fork is not currently in the original SM64EX, but it supports building the <a href=https://github.com/alex-free/sm64ex>master</a> and <a href=https://github.com/alex-free/sm64ex/tree/nightly>nightly</a> branches with both SDL 1 and my fork of SDL 2.0.6 named <a href=https://github.com/alex-free/leopard_sdl2.0.6>Leopard_SDL2</a>. I have written <a href=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/alex-free/9d7c255cb0685909a95de2a6d9f08c13/raw/6d7e3520625318eee2f709383fb039fb1e445c6d/build_sm64ex_mac_os_x_powerpc.txt>build instructions</a> to compile yourself.</p>

<p><a href=https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex>SM64EX</a>, and by extension my <a href=https://github.com/alex-free/sm64ex>fork</a> do not have any licensing terms.</p>

<a name=tonyhaxcd><h3><a href=https://alex-free.github.io/tonyhax-boot-cd>TonyHax Boot CD</h3></a>

<p>TonyHax, without the Hax, Tony, or memory card/specific game requirement!</p>

<a name=21c><h3><a href=https://github.com/alex-free/21c>21c</a> - BlackJack/21 for every computer</a></h3></a>

<p>21/BlackJack is my favorite card game. 21c is a text based implementation of it written in C89. There is an 'infinite' deck to draw from, a load/save feature to continue where you left of, a dealer determined to win, the ability to place custom bets, 'graphics', and more!</p>

<p>21C supports anything with a C89 compliant compiler. Releases are available for Mac OS 8+, Mac OS X 10.3.9+, Windows 95+, and MSDOS 3.3+. It has been built by DevCPP 4.99.5, Xcode 3.0, TurboC++ 3.0, and GCC 10.</p>

<a name=build_select><h3><a href=https://github.com/alex-free/build-select>Build Select</a> - Makes compiling for various Mac OS X versions, SDKs, and arches easy</h3></p></a>

<p>Mac OS X backwards compatibility used to be pretty great. Set some flags and it usually works itself out. But it has always been a pain to gloabally compile things for older versions.</p>

<p>Build Select changes all that, execute a single command and you'll be compiling for the Mac OS X 10.3.9 SDK using gcc 4.0, for the ppc arch, at the 10.3 API level. You can even set your own custom build flags, if you want to override CFLAGS/LDFLAGS now you simply can.</p>

<p>Build Select is open source software written in bash, licensed under the BSD 3 Clause license.</p>

<a name=dcdib><h3><a href=https://alex-free.github.io/dcdib>Dreamcast CDI Burner</a> - Burn all Dreamcast .CDI file types to bootable CD-ROMs on Linux and Mac OS X</h3></a>

<p>The Sega Dreamcast console was released in 1998 and 1999 around the world. It actually had pretty good copy protection mechanisms in place. However, the MIL-CD support in most Sega Dreamcast consoles provided a clever exploit which allows burned CD-ROMs to boot, instead of actual GD-ROM discs. This is in my opinion <b>the best</b> console exploit to ever exist.</p>

<p>Today the most common Sega Dreamcast software file format is .CDI, used by the proprietary Windows only DiscJuggler format. This does not mean you need Windows, because Dreamcast CDI Burner can extract and burn all .CDI Sega Dreamcast file types on Linux and Mac OS X with a collection of open source software.</p>


<a name=o95kg><h3><a href=https://alex-free.github.io/open95keygen>Open95Keygen</a> - Generate random valid Windows 95/NT 4.0 OEM/Retail Product Keys</h3></a>

<p>Open95Keygen is a portable open source program that generates random valid Product Keys (both OEM and Retail types) for Microsoft's Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 operating systems. Mac OS 8/9 68k/PowerPC, Mac OS X 10.3.9-10.6.8 PowerPC, Linux x86_64, and Linux x86 releases are available.</p>

<p>Open95Keygen is open source software written in C89/Ansi-C and is licensed under the BSD 3 Clause license.</p>

<a name=o95kgpsx><h3><a href=https://alex-free.github.io/open95keygen-psx>Open95Keygen PSX</a> - Generate random valid Windows 95/NT 4.0 OEM/Retail Product Keys With A PSX/PS1</h3></a>

<p>Open95Keygen PSX is a PSX/PS1 homebrew program that generates random valid Product Keys (both OEM and Retail types) for Microsoft's Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 operating systems.</p>

<p>Open95Keygen is open source software written in C89/Ansi-C and is licensed under the BSD 3 Clause license.</p>

<a name=sm64exlc><h3><a href=https://alex-free.github.io/sm64exlc>Super Mario 64 EX Leopard Compiler</a></h3></a>

<p>SM64EX is a native Super Mario 64 port derived from the decompilation of Super Mario 64. SM64EXLC is an easy to use, point and click GUI app that compiles my <a href=https://github.com/alex-free/sm64ex>SM64EX</a> fork of the original <a href=https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex>SM64EX</a> port on PowerPC Mac OS X Leopard into a portable <code>SM64EX.app</code> on your <code>~/Desktop</code>.</p>

<a name=sm64gsw><h3><a href=https://alex-free.github.io/sm64gsw>SuperMario64GameSharkWriter</a> - Write GameShark Codes To A USA SM64 ROM file</h3></a>

<p>Super Mario 64 had a lot of cool cheat codes. Now you can easily edit your unmodified or hacked ROM file to always use cheat codes of your choices with the SuperMario64GameSharkWriter program. SM64GSW can either read a list of codes written in a .txt file, or allow you to input codes. It will then edit the ROM for you.</p>

<p>Even better, SM64GSW also patches the checksum check in the ROM file so that emulators can boot the ROM file without further changes. The resulting ROMs work even on <a href=https://mupen64plus.org/>Mupen64Plus</a>, which is something the very old CHKSUM64 program can not do. This makwes SM64GSW a better alternative then using CHKSUM64 to get your edited ROMs to boot. You can invoke soley this functionallity using SM64GSW without writing any codes to the ROM as well.</p>

<p>SM64GSW performs <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/messiaen64/>messian's</a> <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/messiaen64/patching-gameshark-codes>patching codes to rom</a> and <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/messiaen64/getting-rid-of-the-checksum-trap>getting rid of the checksum trap</a> methods entirely in software.</p>

<p>SM64GSW is written in C89 and is licensed under the BSD 3 Clause license. Windows 95-Windows 10, PowerPC Mac OS X, Linux x86, and Linux x86_64 releases are available.</p>
