<p><em>By Alex Free</em> - Manual: v1.0.1 (2/8/2023)</p>
<p>The PlayStation was released in Japan in 1994, and elsewhere in 1995.
The last models where manufactured in 2006. In 2022 it is very common to
run into PS1 CD drive related issues, in fact it can sometimes feel like
a miracle if you can find a console without any problems still working
in current year. Information about how to fix poorly performing CD
drives for PlayStation consoles is scattered all over the internet at
this point, with various truths and fictions about certain fixes and the
issues that they address.</p>
<p>A certain fix almost never talked about is to clean and then
re-lubricate all the moving parts of the CD drive itself. The ideas
behind this fix are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CD drives worked great and could read CD-Rs and pressed CD-ROMs
when new (even the launch units!).</li>
<li>CD drive technology was still evolving throughout the PlayStation’s
console life cycle. Early CD drive technology especially is prone to
disc read errors when the expected level of friction encountered by the
moving parts is out of spec.</li>
<li>The level of friction can increase and can cause disc read errors as
the original grease used to lubricate the moving parts degrades with
time due to age, loosing it’s original effectiveness.</li>
<li>Most CD drive’s have <strong>perfectly functioning laser
diodes</strong>. A dying laser diode is most likely quite rare to
actually encounter <strong>if the laser resistance screw has never been
modified before</strong> (which can decrease laser resistance,
increasing power out of spec for the diode, and possibly cause it to
burn out faster).</li>
</ul>
<p>Simply following this service manual can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fix FMV stutters/glitches/playback failure.</p></li>
<li><p>Decrease previously abnormally high load times.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a console that normally only read discs if you turn the
entire console vertical or upside down <strong>(try this if you haven’t
yet!)</strong> work in the correct, standard orientation.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix stuttering and or lag in games that steam a lot of data off
of the disc during play.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix sudden cut-outs/silence during CD audio playback.</p></li>
<li><p>Stop the CD drive from constantly gets ‘lost’ trying to track the
CD, sometimes causing runoff where the laser sled seeks all the way to
the end of the disc before possibly completely ‘giving up’ reading the
disc entirely.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix loud harsh noises coming from the CD Drive, such as clicking
and rattling.</p></li>

<h2 id="tools-used">Tools Used</h2>
<p>This guide requires quite a few things to complete it. Before
continuing you should have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Pack of clean, fine-tipped, thin, and very small
paintbrushes..</li>
<li>At least 2 clean toothbrushes.</li>
<li>A tube of white lithium grease.</li>
<li>A bottle of synthetic light clock oil containing no preservatives,
with a funnel top.</li>
<li>A can of WD-40.</li>
<li>A bowl of clean water.</li>
<li>A bowl of soapy water.</li>
<li>A <code>flathead #2 screwdriver</code>.</li>
<li>A <code>Phillips #00 screwdriver</code>.</li>
<li>A <code>Phillips #1 screwdriver</code>.</li>
<li>Paper towels.</li>
<li>A clean high thread count microfiber cloth.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cleaning-all-moving-parts">Cleaning All Moving Parts</h2>
<p>The first thing to do is to remove and strip all the original
lubrication from the CD drive. Any original lubrication in a PS1 CD
drive has long since lost it’s ability to provide enough frictionless
movement for the laser sled and spindle motor to operate optimally at
this point in time due to the sheer age of the hardware itself. In order
to do this, we need to completely remove the CD drive itself from the
console. Once the CD drive is removed, the CD drive top case can then be
removed as well giving access to every lubrication point in the CD
drive.</p>
<p>To remove the CD drive from the console, you must first do one
specific task while the PlayStation is all assembled:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect the console up, put in an Audio CD, and power it on.</li>
<li>Using the PlayStation CD Player play the audio track that is in the
middle of the audio CD. I.e., if your audio CD has 18 tracks, play track
9. If you have an odd amount of tracks, divide by 2 and round up
(i.e. for 19 tracks play track 10). While the audio is playing, power
off the PlayStation console. This will ‘lock’ the laser sled around the
halfway point of the laser sled rails, allowing you to remove the CD
drive top case later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that the laser sled is in the right position, unplug any memory
cards, remove the audio CD in the CD drive, and remove the power and
video cables from the Playstation console. Flip the entire console
upside down so that the model sticker is visible. Unscrew the 5
<code>Phillips #1</code> screws on the bottom of the PlayStation
console. After all screws are removed flip the PlayStation back over
right side up. Take off the top case of the console by simply raising it
off of the lower base, exposing the CD drive/motherboard.</p>

</figure>
<p>There are 2 different cables connecting the PS1 CD drive to the
motherboard. The first one addressed is the laser ribbon cable, which is
wide, thin, and red/orange. It is secured with a locking connector on
the motherboard. Gently pull up on the left ‘wing’ of the locking
socket, and then do the same to the right ‘wing’ on the right side of
the locking socket. This will fully unlock the connector and release the
laser ribbon cable. The laser ribbon cable can now be pulled gently out
of the locking socket exposing it’s contacts.</p>

<img src="images/7-laser-ribbon-loose.jpg" alt="laser ribbon loose" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">laser ribbon loose</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The second cable is what I dub the ‘power wires’. They are the thin
multicolored group of wires connecting to a socket on the CD drive
itself. Gently pull the power wires away from the socket on the CD drive
itself to remove them, finally freeing the CD drive itself.</p>

</figure>
<p>Unscrew the 2 <code>Phillips #00</code> screws on each side of the
spindle motor which secure CD drive top case to the rest of the CD
drive. Once these screws are removed, push the CD drive’s top case
forward (away from the spindle motor). Once it slides over the CD drive
a bit forward, start pushing diagonally away from the spindle motor and
to the right. The CD drive top case should just slide right out,
exposing the CD drive’s internals.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">cd drive top case removed</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With the CD drive top case now removed, we can get to work. Use a
clean wet toothbrush (water or soapy water) to remove any remaining
grease on all of the gears which connect the laser sled motor to the
laser sled.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/13-clean-top-sled-gears.jpg" alt="clean sled gears" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">clean sled gears</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Flip the CD drive over and make sure to get the bottom part of the
laser sled motor gear as well.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/14-clean-bottom-sled-gear.jpg"
alt="clean bottom sled gear" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">clean bottom sled gear</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Next clean the bottom of the laser sled rails with a wet (water or
soapy water) fine tipped paintbrush. Strip off all of the grease
thoroughly on the rails.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/15-clean-bottom-rails.jpg" alt="clean bottom rails" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">clean bottom rails</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Flip the CD drive back over and clean the top of the laser rails in
the same way</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/16-clean-top-rails.jpg" alt="clean top rails" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">clean top rails</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With the laser rails and laser sled motor gears cleaned move on to
the next area of interest, the spindle motor. This is the motor that
spins the CD. The first thing the spindle motor needs is WD-40. Heavily
douse a different clean fine tipped paintbrush in WD-40 and push the
liquid from the brushes into the motor via the various access holes
found on the bottom of the motor. Because the access holes are on the
bottom of the motor, this means you will need to once again flip the
entire CD drive upside down. Once WD-40 is in the motor, manually spin
the spindle by hand a few times every few minutes for 30 minutes to
further distribute the WD-40.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/17-spindle-motor-wd40.jpg" alt="spindle motor WD-40" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">spindle motor WD-40</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Keep the CD drive upside down, let the WD-40 seep in for 30 minutes
or so before continuing. After you’ve waited, give the laser sled motor
WD-40 via it’s single access hole. Keep in mind this motor is much
smaller.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">sled motor WD-40</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="lubricating-all-moving-parts">Lubricating All Moving Parts</h2>
<p>Keep the entire CD drive propped up vertically to let the WD-40 seep
in for 30 minutes. After waiting, place the CD drive back flat, but
still upside down. Take your <strong>synthetic light clock oil with no
preservatives</strong> and put some oil in the access holes of the
spindle motor. Once the oil is in the motor, manually spin the spindle
by hand a few times every few minutes for 30 minutes to further
distribute the oil.</p>

</figure>
<p>Now that the liquids in each motor are settled, move on to
lubricating the laser sled gears. Flip the CD drive back right side up.
Put some white lithium gears on a clean toothbrush, and brush the sled
motor top gears.</p>

<p>Now that every moving part has been cleaned and lubricated, put the
laser ribbon cable back into it’s slot and put the CD drive top case
back on. To put the CD drive top case back on you want to come in from
the right and press down to slide it carefully under/around the spindle
itself.</p>

</figure>
<p>Now that everything is into place, check your PlayStation to see if
you have 2 screws near the laser ribbon socket connector like below.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/33-bias-gain-screws.jpg" alt="bias and gain screws" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">bias and gain screws</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>If you do not see these screws, you are done and can now <a
href="#test">test</a> your self-refurbished CD drive!</strong> If you do
see these screws, keep continuing in the guide below.</p>
<h2 id="manual-bias-adjustments">Manual Bias Adjustments</h2>
<p>On the early consoles the bias and gain values are not automatically
adjusted by the PS1 motherboard like on all newer PS1 console revisions.
They are manually set by the bias screw and the gain screw. When you get
a new CD drive connected the bias and gain values may change from what
they should be, or you may find that the CD drive does not work as well
as it can without slight adjustments to these values. If you measure the
bias value to not be <code>1.634v</code> in an ‘idle’ state (no CD in
drive/drive open), and if the gain value is not around
<code>1.825v</code> measured while playing CD audio, consider changing
them to these values (as described in the process below) as it can
further improve disc reading performance, especially in regards to
burned CD-R media.</p>
<p>To first measure the current bias value on the motherboard, power on
the PlayStation console with the CD drive connected, but with no disc on
the CD Drive spindle. Leave the lid sensor unblocked. The console is in
an ‘idle’ state like this. Using a multi-meter set to measure voltage,
connect the positive lead to the bias point (as displayed in the image
below) and the negative lead to anywhere on the top metal shielding of
the PS1 console found under the CD drive to ground the Bias point. The
voltage value your multi-meter displays while your console is in ‘idle’
is the current bias value that your motherboard is set to.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/34-get-current-bias.jpg" alt="get current bias" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">get current bias</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To secondly measure the gain value on the motherboard, Go into the CD
Player on the console (which should still be powered on at this point).
Place an audio CD on the exposed CD drive’s spindle. Tape down the lid
sensor at the top right of the exposed lower case of the PlayStation
console (this is a black switch when the top case of the console is
removed). Keep the negative lead grounded on the metal shield found
around the motherboard and below the installed CD drive. Play any audio
track on the CD. While the audio is playing put the positive lead of
your multi-meter back on the same bias point you measured before. The
voltage reading will have slightly changed, this is the gain value found
currently on your motherboard.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/35-get-current-gain.jpg" alt="get current gain" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">get current gain</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To change your bias value to <code>1.634v</code>, untape the lid
sensor (unblocking it and stopping the spindle motor) and remove the CD
from the CD drive’s exposed spindle to put the console back into an
‘idle’ state. Keep the negative lead of the multi-meter grounded on the
metal shield found around the motherboard and below the installed CD
drive. Put the positive lead of your multi-meter back on the Bias point.
Use a <code>flathead #2 screwdriver</code> to very slightly change the
bias screw’s position on the motherboard, rotating the screw until you
get to that value. Rotate <strong>CLOCKWISE to increase the Bias voltage
value</strong> on the multi-meter. Rotate <strong>COUNTER-CLOCKWISE to
decrease the Bias voltage value</strong> on the multi-meter.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/36-change-bias.jpg" alt="change bias" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">change bias</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After setting the bias value, you can set the gain value. You should
still be in the CD Player on the console at this point of the guide.
Place an audio CD or a PS1 game containing CD audio (backup or real PS1
disc both work for this) on the exposed CD drive’s spindle. Tape down
the lid sensor at the top right of the exposed lower case of the
PlayStation console. This is a black button when the top case of the
console is removed). Keep the negative lead of the multi-meter grounded
on the metal shield found around the motherboard and below the installed
CD drive. Play any audio track on the CD. While the audio is playing put
the positive lead of your multi-meter back on the bias point. While
taking the current gain voltage reading use a
<code>flathead #2 screwdriver</code> to very slightly change the bias
screw’s position on the motherboard, rotating the screw until you get to
that value. <strong>Rotate CLOCKWISE to decrease the gain
voltage</strong> reading. This is because gain is a value to subtract
from the Bias. Rotate <strong>COUNTER-CLOCKWISE to increase the gain
voltage</strong> reading. This is because gain is a value to subtract
from the Bias.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>Many places online constantly state that the
Bias should be 1.7v and the Gain should be 1.82v. This info is mostly
coming from this website: <a
href="http://dogbreath.de/PS1/LaserAlignment/Laser.html">http://dogbreath.de/PS1/LaserAlignment/Laser.html</a>.
In my experience, the Bias value of 1.7v is too high. It seems to make
it harder for the laser sled to track spinning discs, and can make drive
runoff happen (which is when the laser sled seeks all the way out to the
end of a spinning disc and gives up reading the disc altogether). So I
do not personally recommend this Bias and Gain value combination.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>Remove any CD from the exposed CD drive’s spindle. <strong>With your
clean high thread count microfiber cloth clean off the laser lens
itself.</strong> Put the top case of the console back on by sliding it
down upon the lower base. I recommend to not put the screws back into
place just yet, just in case you find you still have some more tweaks to
do after performing the tests below.</p>

<li>The first test is to go to the CD player and play a CD. Seek around
the beginning of the CD disc (play the first audio track) and the end of
the disc (play the last audio track) to move the laser sled (and the
grease) and the new lubrication around inside the CD drive. Listen to
how the CD drive sounds. After everything you’ve done it should be very
quiet for a PS1 CD drive. The laser sled seeking should sound clean and
concise (if it does not apply more white lithium grease to the rails,
make sure everything has a decent even coat). The spindle motor should
not rattle (if it does put more WD-40 and then later synthetic light
clock oil without preservatives all over again).</li>
<li>With audio CDs playing well, move on to the big guns and start a
game with FMVs and also preferably containing CD audio (such as Dead Or
Alive). Put in a decently long play session immediately after. FMVs
should not skip. CD audio should not skip. The ultimate test might be
something like playing the game Fear Effect, which has streaming FMV
backgrounds during game play and a ton of FMVS.</li>
<li>I definitely recommend playing some games for an hour or 2
immediately after your refurbishment to make sure your repairs were
successful. Game choice is really up to you.</li>

New PS1 CD Drive Unit</h2>
<p>While refurbishing and servicing PS1 CD drives can in many cases get
a problematic drive working like new again, this is not always the case
if hardware failures such as the laser diode itself burning out occur.
In such a case it is best to replace the entire PS1 CD drive with a
different one that either works, or can work after refurbishment.</p>
<p>The <strong>best</strong> way to get a replacement CD drive if you
end up needing one is to simply buy a working PS1 console and pull an
original Sony manufactured CD drive from it for use in your desired
target console. PSone consoles are your best bet for a working CD drive
as they are the newest ones made and most likely have the least amount
of wear. However, other models of the console can also work just
fine.</p>
