<center><h2>The SCPH-1000 Hardware</h2></center>

<p>The original Sony PlayStation was released on December 3rd, 1994 in Japan. The first model was known as the SCPH-1000. The serial number is belived to have started at <code>A5000000</code>, and all units up to <code>A5300000</code> are belived to either of been given to Sony Executives and their families, used in testing, or used in some other internal manner according to this <a href=http://www.psxdev.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1432>thread</a> on <a href=https://psxdev.net>PSXDEV.NET</a>. There are actually 2 different revisions of the SCPH-1000 model. The first revision has the original CD Drive controller firmware known as VC0A, which is dated 9/24/1994 A known serial number with this CD Drive controller firmware is <code>A5532655</code>. The second revision has the CD drive controller firmware known as VC0B, which is dated 11/18/1994. A serial number is also available for this revision, <code>A6145548</code>.</p>

<p>All SCPH-1000 consoles have BIOS v1.0 (there actually is not a version string in the BIOS, so it is referred to retroactively as v1.0) as well as S-Video output directly on the back of the console.</p>

<h2>SCPH-1000 Bugs/Exploits</h2>


 <p>The PS1 copy protection is designed in this manner according to the Sony <a href="US6304971_DIGITAL COMPACT DISC PLAYER SECURITY SYSTEM REPRODUCING METHOD AND APPARATUS (Ken Kutaragi; Tetsuya Hirano).pdf">patent</a> relating to the copy protection:</p>

 <ul>
    <li>The CD Drive controller looks for a region specific "wobbled" ATIP data in the first few sectors of the CD disc. The area on disc that this "wobbled" data is at is earlier on the disc then what is possible to burn/reproduce to a CD-R, as each CD-R is manufactured with it's own ATIP data already pre-pressed in this area. The ATIP data on a normal CD-R is required by a CD burner to tell it how to burn the CD-R, so a CD-R can not be made without this ATIP data (which is pressed like a true CD-ROM) filling up the first few sectors of the CD-R. CD-ROMs are not containing any ATIP data because they are completely pressed when manufactured, not burned. PS1 game discs are using this fact to prevent the wobbled ATIP data found on PS1 game discs from being reproducable to a CD-R. Although one can press real CD-ROMs with the wobbled ATIP data, (i.e. the unofficial PSX Change disc swap trick disc), the exact wobbled ATIP data is not really publicly known.</li>
    <li>The CD Drive controller then looks for the license data at Sector 4 (not counting pre-gap) and compares it to it's own internal copy. Each region has it's own license data.

    <li>


 The secondary-region lock in this BIOS is also bugged and does not prevent games with non-japanese license data at sector 4 from booting.</p>
